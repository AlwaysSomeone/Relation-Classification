# Relation Classification

Relation Classification using LSTM between two given entities.

We tried many ways to classify relations.

* Classify using LSTM Networks along Shortest Dependency Paths.
* Classify using bidirectional LSTM Networks on LCA Sub Tree.
* Classification using LSTMS on Sequences and Tree Structures.

Better performance is achived using LSTMs over Dependency Trees.
