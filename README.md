# Relation Classification in Tensorflow

Relation Classification using LSTM between two given entities.

We tried many ways to classify relations.

* [Classify using LSTM Networks along Shortest Dependency Paths.](https://github.com/Sshanu/Relation-Classification/tree/master/LCA%20Shortest%20Path)
* [Classify using bidirectional LSTM Networks on LCA Sub Tree.](https://github.com/Sshanu/Relation-Classification/tree/master/LCA%20SubTree)
* [Classification using LSTMS on Sequences and Tree Structures.](https://github.com/Sshanu/Relation-Classification/tree/master/LSTM%20Seq%20and%20Tree)

Better performance is achived using LSTMs over Dependency Trees.
